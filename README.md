01/04/24 - changing commissioner font to inter, make sure to install it "yay -S ttf-inter", added some necessary window rules.

20/03/24 - iosevka was cool, but way too narrow. i decided to give a shot FantasqueSansM Nerd Font, make sure to install it, looks beautiful, nice for coding too. besides that i changed waybar layout to a bit more traditional look with clocks at right side. also dont forget about xcursor, now you cant set it via hyrpctl setcursor.

14/03/24 - i keep develope thin compact theme from previous update. now i decide to switch from hack font to iosevka. its a good way to make accent on thin theme. im fairly satisfied with result tbh. hope you like it too.

11/03/24 - another big style update. sorry guys but i cant keep these cool looking thick borders. i started to use master layout more and more and those pixels from borders and gaps, they are really crucial for working space. now overall look is lighter than ever before, its can be fine for some, try it anyway.

26/02/24 - added new modules to waybar: idle_inhibitor and keyboard-state, to be able to use keyboard state u need to add urself to input group "sudo usermod -aG input $USER"

04/02/24 - big update, we are moving to thinner, less rounded, and more light style. We have smaller fonts and less gaps. I think its time to move to more utilitary direction, big gaps and thick borders just take too much space, althought its looks good. I tried to save same aestetics, but make theme less heavy.

nvim files are not maintained, because i managed to fully switch to emacs somehow. sorry.
