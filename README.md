26/02/24 - added new modules to waybar: idle_inhibitor and keyboard-state, to be able to use keyboard state u need to add urself to input group "sudo usermod -aG input $USER"

04/02/24 - big update, we are moving to thinner, less rounded, and more light style. We have smaller fonts and less gaps. I think its time to move to more utilitary direction, big gaps and thick borders just take too much space, althought its looks good. I tried to save same aestetics, but make theme less heavy.


Cursors - capitaine cursors gruvbox (gnome-look.org)

Icons - gruvbox-plus-dark

Theme - gruvbox-dark-bl-lb

Fonts used - Hack Nerd Font, Commissioner, awesome font

Necessary apps for me - playerctl, grimshot, nm-applet, 
blueman-applet, calcurse, nwg-look, swaylock-effects!!!, wlogout!!!, redshift!!! 

keep in mind, theme looks way better with redshift warm colors, place your location in config to switch between day/night modes automatically
