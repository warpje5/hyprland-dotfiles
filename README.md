Cursors - capitaine cursors gruvbox (gnome-look.org)

Icons - gruvbox-plus-dark

GTK Theme - gruvbox-dark-medium-bl-lb

Fonts used - Hack, Hack Nerd Font, Inter (we always get back to the basics)

Necessary apps - playerctl, hyprshot, nm-applet, kvantum
blueman-applet, nwg-look, swaylock-effects!!!, wlogout!!!, gammastep, starship, cliphist and everything for it, 

keep in mind, theme looks way better with gammastep warm colors, place your location in config 
to switch between day/night modes automatically
